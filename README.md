üçï Pizza Sales Analysis and Visualization üìä

Excited to share a project I've been working on that showcases the power of data analysis and visualization in the pizza industry! üìàüçï

In this project, we tackled the challenge of understanding pizza sales trends, identifying key performance indicators, and creating insightful visualizations using SQL and Power BI. Here's a breakdown of what we accomplished:

Data Import and Preparation:
We began by centralizing our raw sales data in an SQL database, ensuring data integrity through rigorous cleaning and preprocessing.

SQL Queries for Analysis:
Our SQL queries unveiled daily and monthly sales trends, helping us spot patterns and fluctuations in pizza sales. We also delved into customer preferences by calculating the percentage of sales by category and size.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Calculation:
KPIs like average order value, total revenue, and customer retention rate were crucial in assessing our performance and success in the pizza sales business.

Power BI Integration and Visualization:
To make our data come alive, we seamlessly connected our SQL database to Power BI. Power Query played a pivotal role in data cleaning and transformation, ensuring accuracy and consistency in our visualizations.

Interactive Dashboards:
Our dashboards tell a compelling story of daily and monthly sales patterns. They also shed light on which pizza items are our best and worst performers, offering insights into the factors at play.

User Experience Enhancement:
To enhance user experience, we added navigator buttons, making it a breeze to navigate between different dashboards and sections.

Conclusion and Insights:
In the end, our project brought to light key findings and insights that are invaluable for making informed decisions and refining our business strategies.

This journey through SQL analysis, Power BI visualization, and insightful dashboard creation has given us a 360-degree view of our pizza sales performance. We're equipped with the knowledge needed to thrive in the competitive pizza industry.
